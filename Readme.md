# kube-query
A kubectl plug-in that makes it easier to query and manipulate K8S clusters.

Kube-query support the some resource shortcut query, like: pods, deploy, service, configmap, dameonset, job, nodes. We can get their simple information, relationship or login container.

Kube-query accepts the same commands as the kubectl, except you don't need to provide the kubectl prefix. So it doesn't require the additional cost to use this cli.

# Installation
